Aromatizapp is an experiment that explores having an aromatizer connected to the internet! You can read a nice blog post [here](https://ramomar.medium.com/aromatizapp-ac97e8b730a8) (spanish).

## Features

- Exposes and endpoint which triggers the _aromatization_ servo-mechanism ðŸ˜›


## Scripts

The scripts folder includes scripts for calling the aromatize endpoint as well as the endpoint for generating an access token.


## Building and flashing the firmware

[Use the Particle tooling](https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/developer-tools/workbench/). Rememer to set correctly the target to whichever device you are using. In this case, I used a [Particle Argon](https://docs.particle.io/argon/).

## Demo video
